1. Preprocessing
Input: Two images: a base UI image and a test UI image.

Operations:

Convert to grayscale.

Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise.

Use thresholding to highlight UI components.

Perform morphological operations (e.g., dilation) to enhance detection of contiguous components.

🧩 2. Component Detection
Uses cv2.findContours() to detect connected regions (UI elements like buttons, text boxes, etc.).

Each detected component is represented as a bounding box: (x, y, width, height).

🔗 3. Component Matching & Comparison
Each base component is compared with test components using:

Intersection over Union (IoU) for shape/area similarity.

Euclidean distance between component centers (centroids) to measure position shift.

🚩 4. Difference Classification
Based on comparisons, components are categorized as:

Type	Condition
Missing	Base component has no sufficiently overlapping match in the test image.
Misplaced	Component matched, but its centroid is beyond the allowed tolerance.
Overlapped	Two components in the test image significantly overlap.

🔧 Tuning:
IoU threshold defines what counts as a match (e.g., 0.5).

Tolerance threshold defines acceptable movement range (e.g., 30 pixels).

These can be adjusted for pixel-perfect UIs or flexible layouts.

🖼️ 5. Annotation & Visualization
An annotated output image is generated from the Test image, with:

🔴 Red boxes for Missing components.

🟡 Yellow boxes for Misplaced components.

🔵 Blue boxes for Overlapping components.

Each box is labeled with the issue type.

📊 Similarity Score
Calculates the percentage of base components successfully matched in the test image:

🔍 Advantages
Requires no training data.

Can be used on any UI, including game UIs, apps, and websites.

Fast and interpretable.

⚠️ Limitations
Sensitive to color/contrast if UIs are not well-contrasted.

Does not detect semantic changes (e.g., text label changes).

May misclassify slight shifts unless thresholds are well-tuned.

💡 Future Enhancements
Use OCR to compare textual content.

Add support for component types via icon/template matching.

Integrate a dynamic tolerance system (relative to component size).

Add feature for automatic diff report generation (JSON/HTML).
